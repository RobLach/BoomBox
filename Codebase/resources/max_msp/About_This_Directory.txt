2/24:
	-receives OSC messages and parses them into useful chunks

3/1:
	-added "mostly" complete skeleton of entire engine
	-OSC messages now actually do things
	-other avatars are created and registered upon receipt of first OSC message with their unique id attached (currently a periodic pulse of a saw wave of a static random frequency is used to signify an avatar)
	-subsequent messages will:
		- affect the pulse's placement in a stereo field
		- the volume of the pulse is relative to other avatar's distance to "myavatar"
	- added a tester patch for sending of test messages
