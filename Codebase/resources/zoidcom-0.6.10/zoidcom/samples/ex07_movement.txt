ex07_movement
-------------

Demonstrates the usage of the movement and player input replicator. The interesting stuff is in
nodeobj.cpp.

This program shows strange behaviour when compiled with vc.net 2003 (and maybe earlier versions)
and full optimization enabled.

Needs Allegro to build and run.
