BoomBox is a massive multiplayer online game with strong musical ties and teamwork based gameplay.The world is split between two distinct factions, which players upon avatar creation choose to join. The
player avatars are musical vehicles which within a certain radius project player-created musical melodieswhich interact with other players and the environment.

The world is constantly changing, with the factionâ€™s borders shifting and buildings being built and
destroyed.The musical environment is dynamic and player controlled.
